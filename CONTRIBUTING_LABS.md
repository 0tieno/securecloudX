## üìù Creating a New Lab

### Step 1: Add Lab Metadata

Edit `src/pages/PentestingLabs.jsx` and add your lab to the `labFiles` array:

```javascript
{
  filename: "your-lab-name.md",
  title: "Your Lab Title",

  estimatedTime: "60", // in minutes
  tools: ["tool1", "tool2", "tool3"],
  description: "Brief description of what the lab covers"
}
```

### Step 2: Create the Lab File

Create your lab file in `public/labs/your-lab-name.md` following our template:
