git clone https://github.com/your-username/securecloudX.git
cd securecloudX

# 2. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b blog/your-topic-name
```

### Step 1: Propose Your Content

Before writing, create an issue with:

```markdown
## Blog Post Proposal

**Title**: Your proposed title
**Category**: [cloud-security|penetration-testing|devsecops|etc.]
**Difficulty**: [beginner|intermediate|advanced]
**Estimated Length**: [1000-2000 words]

### Summary

Brief description of what you plan to cover

### Outline

- Main topic 1
- Main topic 2
- Practical examples/labs

### Target Audience

Who will benefit from this content?
```

### Step 2: Write Your Content

Use our blog manager to create your post:

```bash
# Interactive creation
node scripts/blog-manager.js create

# Or specify details directly
node scripts/blog-manager.js create "Advanced Cloud Pentesting" --tags security,cloud,pentesting
```

## ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Guidelines

### Content Standards

#### Technical Accuracy

- **Verify all commands** and code snippets work
- **Test on multiple environments** when applicable
- **Cite sources** for claims and statistics
- **Include version numbers** for tools and software

#### Security Best Practices

- **Never include real credentials** or sensitive data
- **Use placeholder values** (e.g., `example.com`, `127.0.0.1`)
- **Warn about destructive commands** with clear callouts
- **Follow responsible disclosure** for vulnerability content

#### Writing Style

```markdown
# Use clear, descriptive headings

## That follow a logical hierarchy

# Write in active voice

‚úÖ "Configure the firewall rules"
‚ùå "The firewall rules should be configured"

# Include practical examples

$ echo "Show actual commands readers can run"

# Add security warnings where needed

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: This command will delete all data
```

### Formatting Requirements

#### Code Blocks

Always specify the language for syntax highlighting:

```bash
# Bash commands
sudo nmap -sS -O target.com
```

```python
# Python scripts
import subprocess
result = subprocess.run(['nmap', '-sS', 'target.com'])
```

```yaml
# Configuration files
apiVersion: v1
kind: SecurityPolicy
metadata:
  name: strict-policy
```

#### Security Callouts

Use these standard callouts:

```markdown
> üîí **SECURITY NOTE**: Important security consideration

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: Potential security risk or destructive action

> üí° **TIP**: Helpful security tip or best practice

> üéØ **LAB**: Hands-on exercise for readers
```

#### Images and Diagrams

```markdown
# Use descriptive alt text

![Nmap scan results showing open ports 22, 80, and 443](images/nmap-scan-results.png)

# Include image sources when relevant

_Image source: OWASP Top 10 2021_
```
