# Data Privacy in Azure

> the customer is fully responsible for the security in the cloud while the cloud provider(in this case azure) is fully responsible for the security of the cloud.

In this blog, we are going to learn what it means to trust Microsoft azure cloud with your data and the privacy concerns.

First of all, what is azure? Azure is a trusted cloud platform for building, deploying, and managing innovative solutions with a pay-as-you-go pricing model launched in 2010.

So when you use Azure services, it means, you are entrusting Microsoft with one of your most valuable assets—your data. You trust that the privacy and confidentiality of the data you store and process in Azure services will be protected and that it will be used only in a way that is consistent with your expectations.

Think about that again.

There are a few important things to know about your data privacy in azure cloud:

1. You’re in control of your data. - the moment you have decided to use any of the cloud service, it is important to remember the shared responsibility model. Which states that, the customer is fully responsible for the security in the cloud while the cloud provider(in this case azure) is fully responsible for the security of the cloud. More of this in the upcoming blogs.
    
    With Azure, you are the owner of the data that you provide for storing and hosting in Azure services. 
    
    In their statement, Microsoft says: 
    
    > We do not share your data with advertiser-supported services, nor do we mine it for any purposes like marketing research or advertising. We process your data only with your agreement, and when we have your agreement, we use your data to provide only the services you have chosen.
    
2. **You choose where your data is located - When you use Azure, you choose where your data is located.**
    
    Microsoft has more than 60 regions linked by one of the largest interconnected networks on the planet, including more than 150 datacenters and growing.
    
3. **Azure secures your data at rest and in transit - With state-of-the-art encryption, Azure protects your data both at rest and in transit.**
    - For data at rest, all data written to the Azure storage platform is encrypted through 256-bit AES encryption and is FIPS 140-2 compliant. By default, Microsoft-managed keys protect your data, and Azure Key Vault helps ensure that encryption keys are properly secured.
    - For data in transit—data moving between user devices and Microsoft datacenters or within and between the datacenters themselves—Microsoft adheres to IEEE 802.1AE MAC Security Standards, and uses and enables your use of industry-standard encrypted transport protocols, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Internet Protocol Security (IPsec).
    
4. **Microsoft defends your data**

    
    In their statement, Microsoft says:
    
    > Because we believe that you have control over your own data, we will not disclose data to a government except as you direct or where required by law. If Microsoft receives a demand for a customer's data, we will direct the requesting party to seek the data directly from the customer. If compelled to disclose or give access to any customer's data, Microsoft will promptly notify the customer and provide a copy of the demand unless legally prohibited from doing so.
    

And all that is good to know. See you in the next blog
