# Hello Open Source

Welcome to the SecureCloudX Open Source Blog!

This is a sample post written in Markdown. You can add more posts by creating new `.md` files in the blogs folder.

## Security Tip

> **CRITICAL:** Always sanitize user-generated content and validate inputs to keep your blog secure.

## Text Highlighting Examples

Here are different ways to emphasize text:

- **Bold text** for important warnings
- _Italic text_ for subtle emphasis
- **Highlighted text** for critical security information
- `inline code` for commands and technical terms

**Example:** When running **penetration tests**, always ensure you have _proper authorization_ and use `nmap -sS` for stealth scanning.

```bash
# Bash commands
echo "Hello World"
```

```javascript
// JavaScript code
console.log("Hello World");
```

```python
# Python code
print("Hello World")
```


`> sudo apt update`
