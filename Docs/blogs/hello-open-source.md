## Security Tip

> **CRITICAL:** Always sanitize user-generated content and validate inputs to keep your blog secure.

## Text Highlighting Examples

Here are different ways to emphasize text:

- **Bold text** for important warnings
- _Italic text_ for subtle emphasis
- <mark>Highlighted text</mark> for critical security information
- `inline code` for commands and technical terms

**Example:** When running <mark>penetration tests</mark>, always ensure you have _proper authorization_ and use `nmap -sS` for **stealth scanning**.

```bash
# Bash commands
echo "Hello World"
```

```javascript
// JavaScript code
console.log("Hello World");
```

```python
# Python code
print("Hello World")
```


`> sudo apt update`
