# Pentester's Guide to Common Network Ports and Protocols

One of the first steps in any penetration test is to identify open ports and the services running on them. Each port and protocol can present unique vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that a pentester can exploit.

> **We dont hack a port**, a port is like a door into the target. The door says much of the type of attacks we can perform. e.g a door to a kitchen tells us we can find food, knives, fire etc.

We'll keep things brief but practical, pointing out what each service is, why it matters in pentesting, and what to look out for.

Ports are divided into two main categories: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). TCP is connection-oriented, while UDP is connectionless. Both have their own sets of common ports.

## TCP Ports

1. FTP – 21 (File Transfer Protocol)

- Often misconfigured with anonymous login.

- Pentesters check for weak creds, cleartext passwords, directory traversal, and misconfigured permissions.

1. SSH – 22 (Secure Shell)

- Secure shell access.

- High-value target for brute-force or credential stuffing.

- Misconfigurations: weak ciphers, old versions, key reuse, exposed private keys.

3. Telnet – 23 (Telecommunication Network)

- Unencrypted remote login.

- Easy to sniff credentials.

- Often found on legacy systems or IoT. Exploitable if still active.

4. SMTP – 25 (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

- Mail transfer.

- Pentesters test for open relays, spoofing, user enumeration (VRFY, EXPN).

- Can reveal internal usernames and lead to phishing/social engineering vectors.

1. DNS – 53 (Domain Name System)

- Handles zone transfers.

- Pentesters attempt zone transfer (AXFR) to dump DNS records.

- Valuable for reconnaissance.

1. HTTP – 80 / HTTPS – 443 (Web Traffic)

- Web services.

- Huge attack surface: XSS, SQLi, LFI/RFI, SSRF, etc.

- HTTPS may have SSL/TLS misconfigurations (weak ciphers, expired certs).

7. POP3 – 110 (Post Office Protocol)

- Email retrieval.

- Credentials often sent in cleartext.

- Pentesters look for weak/harvested creds to pivot into mailboxes.

8. SMB – 139 / 445 (Server Message Block)

- File sharing (Windows).

- Commonly exploited in EternalBlue, relay attacks, null sessions.

- Pentesters check for open shares, weak perms, and credential reuse.

9. IMAP – 143 (Internet Message Access Protocol)

- Another mail protocol.

- Supports cleartext logins unless secured (IMAPS).

- Pentesters target weak creds, mailbox data, and lateral movement.

## UDP Ports

1. DNS – 53 (Domain Name System)

- Basic name resolution.

- Used for amplification in DDoS attacks.

- Pentesters test for open recursion and spoofable responses.

2. DHCP – 67, 68 (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

- IP address assignment.

- Pentesters may try DHCP starvation or rogue DHCP server attacks to redirect traffic.

3. TFTP – 69 (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)

- Trivial File Transfer Protocol.

- No authentication.

- Pentesters check for unrestricted download/upload of config files (often router/switch configs with creds).

4. SNMP – 161 (Simple Network Management Protocol)

- Management protocol.

- Default community strings (public / private) often exposed.

- Can leak system configs, routing info, even creds.

**As a pentester, the strategy is**:

- Identify open ports (Nmap, Masscan).

- Enumerate services (banner grabbing, NSE scripts).

- Check for misconfigurations, weak creds, and known exploits.
