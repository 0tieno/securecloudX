          What is this Capstone Project?  
          The capstone project brings everything together. You'll secure a full Azure deployment using all the tools, configurations, and strategies learned over the last 6 days.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-sm sm:text-base mt-3">
          Why is this important?  
          A secure deployment ensures that your environment is protected from external and internal threats, preventing data breaches and operational disruptions.
